# Album Collection Application

This project was built using the MERN stack, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and React. I also utilized Tailwind CSS

## Features
This application can add new Albums to the database, edit albums, delete albums, and can display information about each album including date and time added and last updated.

## Usage
In order to use this, go to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a database. Then add a config.js file into the backend folder, and in that config.js file add a PORT variable and a mongoDBUrl variable associated with your database.
